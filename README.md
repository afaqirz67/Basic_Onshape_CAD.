### Caster

## [Base](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/a1a8fbff1a52087c86742253/w/41d076647d3f34ffada20396/e/ab704ebd26d3af3a5872dc55)
This is the first assignment of the year. Although we were back to cad after a long break, everything was still fresh in my mind, and I got this done easily. Tools that I used for sketching the Base was rectangle, extrude, circle, and the deminsion tool. I learned some keyboard shortcuts for Onshape. C is for circle, and r is for center point rectangle.

 ## [Mount](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/45af29bf07bcc67cdddb9f5f/w/842545aa3e03b2a4b8cc6685/e/e5955096f16f22f76e128d41)
 The Mount is pretty much the same as the Base. I used the same tools for sketching the mount.

 ## [Fork](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/6e1209cf5b1a546f13e94c34/w/937fddc127df03bf9e80059c/e/9006052673757bfd6f746637)
 This part is a combination of circles, and rectangles. It looks really hen you are actually done with the sketch. Tools that I used in this sketch were circle, extrude, corner rectangle, miror, fillet, and as always the deminsion tool. I learned the keyboard shortcuts for a cornor rectangle which is the letter g, and the shortcut for fillet which is the letter f.

 ## [Tire](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/0547010827caa2a2327b200a/w/ea23f9673d7bfbddfbf6f078/e/308f4d3feb4fa533d977fb9e)
 This sketch looks simple if you look at a finished design although, it's a strange, and a little complex geometric shape before it's revolved and looks great is you can see it down below. A new feature I used in this assigment is the revolve tool. It's actually a really useful feature to use. I learned the usage of this cool feature by doing this assignment.

 ## [Axle and Collar](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/3412283156c6ef03c51b62f0/w/74258853918e3c6013f4552f/e/5ba64ff699a485ea18b4ef72)
 Here I have the Axle and the Collar. The Axle in the caster is point 0. Every other part is somehow held together by the Axle. The collar helps the tire stay in the middle of the collar. It prevents it from sliding left and right.  I learned how to make a new part on a pre-made part by using its geometry by doing this assignment.

 ## [Wheel and Bearing](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/90b8e4775c2488d93ee7121e/w/fa5765508ff0dc0b373c5c1f/e/77010210dab452b6c83e2c6f)
 I have the wheel and the bearing here that are mated together. Bearing is another part of the caster which goes between the tire and the fork to prevent them from colliding. Everything in the caster will be held by the tire, after being assembled. I learned how to use the circular feature which is a helpful tool. It does a great job of duplicating a selected feature in a circular pattern that saves a tremendous amount of time. It places the duplicates of the selected feature around a specific place we appoint it to.

 ## [Sub Assembly](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/718d04b302bc9abda1306eae/w/e80a4655ccdcb3553d075d67/e/748012bee68ec1bc5cf413fd)
 This is how the tire looks after being assembled! It's really awesome and amazing how easy it is to assemble parts in Onshape. It doesn't take more than 3 clicks to assemble two parts. I learned using Fastened mate. It locks the assembled parts tpgether and does not let them move.

 ## [Caster Assembly](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/24268be370a1901126b6e124/w/6c33b005d84a94f533b0982d/e/d6c9ce60cd1b80d16e25b4f4)
 Finally I have all the parts assembled here. Now we can see a good look of how and what every different part is doing. What their tasks are and where they are. I learned that the shortcut for the fastened mate is the letter m.
