### Caster

## Base
This is the first assignment of the year. Although we were back to cad after a long break, everything was still fresh in my mind, and I got this done easily. Tools that I used for sketching the Base was rectangle, extrude, circle, and the deminsion tool. I learned some keyboard shortcuts for Onshape. C is for circle, and r is for center point rectangle.

 ## Mount
 The Mount is pretty much the same as the Base. I used the same tools for sketching the mount.

 ## Fork
 This part is a combination of circles, and rectangles. It looks really hen you are actually done with the sketch. Tools that I used in this sketch were circle, extrude, corner rectangle, miror, fillet, and as always the deminsion tool. I learned the keyboard shortcuts for a cornor rectangle which is the letter g, and the shortcut for fillet which is f.

 ## Tire
 This sketch looks simple if you look at a finished design although, it's a strange, and a little complex geometric shape before it's revolved and looks great is you can see it down below. A new feature I used in this assigment is the revolve tool. It's actually a really useful feature to use. I learned the usage of this cool feature by doing this assignment.
